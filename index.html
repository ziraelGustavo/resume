    <h3 id="EI">Essential Information</h3>
    <p>Hi! I'm the most curious person you'll ever meet, especially if it's about technology!
    <ul>
        <li>I was born in <strong>Brazil</strong>, <em>SÃ£o Paulo - SP!</em></li>
        <li>I'm <strong>22 years old</strong>.</li>
        <li>I'm a <strong>freelance digital designer</strong> specialized on <em>branding</em>, <em>UX & UI</em> and <em>social media</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="who">Who is Gustavo?</h3>
    <p>For starters, a stoic believer that when building a product, <strong>the makers should always think about the end user</strong>.
        I got fed up using software products and/or web stuff that worked against me rather than for me, <em>so I decided to build them myself!</em><br><br>
        
        I hope to bring more <strong>humanity</strong> and <strong>thoughtfulness</strong> to the field of programming through my projects and works. As a designer, my convictions
        rests solely on the principle of providing a <strong>good (responsive, consise, secure, elegant and inclusive) user experience</strong>.<br><br>

        Other than that, I love to cook, read and write high fantasy literature, watching movies and shows, spend quality time with the folks that I love
        and - last but not least - <strong>play games!</strong> I was a professional Counter-Strike and Overwatch esport player in my teens - and although my competitive days are over,
        to this day I enjoy some FPSs. RPGs, MMOs and... any kind of game really. Sorry-not-sorry for the nerdy passage!
    </p>

    <h3 id="proud">What am I most proud of?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>My ability to <strong>empathize with people's problems</strong>.</li>
        <li>Undestanding that Rome was not built in a day, and not by just one person.</li>
        <li>Believing that we, humans, are not perfect beings, and that <strong>the most valuable thing in life is learning from our mistakes</strong>.</li>
        <li>Knowing full well that the world, as of now, is not a place of equity, and if we can work together to bring opportunities to poeple of all profiles and backgrounds,
            <strong>then we should make that a priority.</strong></li>
        <li>And if I am to lead, may I do it with <strong>vision, responsability, love and respect for others</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
